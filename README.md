### compile/build/run with cargo
`````shell
# to create new project
$ cargo new <project_name>
# TO build project for debugging(with faster build time) 
$ cargo build
# Production release build
$ cargo build --release

# build project with dependencies and run main function.
$ cargo run

# Cargo also provides a command called cargo check. 
# This command quickly checks your code to make sure it compiles but doesnâ€™t produce an executable
$ cargo check 
# with backtrace enabled.
$ RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo run
#to understand a specific cause of an error
$ rustc --explain E0308
#To increase verbosity of logs to see in more detail what has been failed.
$ cargo run --verbose
`````
Running cargo build for the first time also causes Cargo to create a new file at the top level: Cargo.lock
